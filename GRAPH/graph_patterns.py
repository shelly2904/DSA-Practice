Eulerian Circuit or path is a path in a graph that visits every edge exactly once.
Given a directed graph, check whether it has an Eulerian Path or not

Eulerian path in directed graph if and only if following conditions are satisfied:
1. out_degree = 1 + in_degree (atmost)
2. in_degree = 1 + out_degree (atmost)
3. in_degree == out_degree
