Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai).
n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0).
Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
